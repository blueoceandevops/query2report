# Query2Report 

#### Overview
How many times have we run SQL queries on RDBMS, extract data, copy it to excel sheet and plot simple trend charts? Why don't use any of the existing BI or reporting tools? The overhead of using heavy weight BI tools is little too much for a simple report/charting requirement. Firstly, you need to have a licensed version, trial versions are good but they don't offer continuity. Secondly, there is a learning curve associated in building reports, no one lets you transform SQL queries to chart directly, you need to know the product in building even a simple report. 

#### Concepts
